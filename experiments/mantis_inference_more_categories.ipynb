      "message: I am still a beginner with GIS. I can't find an easy way to get a maximum distance from multiple points. I have a layer of up to 100 points (without a unique ID - maybe that is part of the problem? but I could easily add that) and I want to get the length of maximum distance between any two of them. I tried plenty of line-points plugins, but nothing seems to work, I also tried to make a minimum convex polygon (basically convex hull of all the points) and get a diagonal of that but failed in all tries again.How do I do this without using a programming language?I am using QGIS 2.18.5\n",

      "message: I've read up on quantum annealing, and particularly on the way it is done by companies like D-wave. I think I understand how it works and how it harnesses tunneling to find global optimal in a given energy potential.But the elephant in the room is: How can it be of any use? What is the point of looking for an optimum in a potential which you yourself have created? If the potential were a black box, then I could see some use. But clearly the potential is prepared in a controllable fashion, so that seems to defeat the purpose.Please clear up my confusion.\n",
